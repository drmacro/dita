          <!--KJE: RDA and I discussed this on 29 April 2019. We could not come up with a phrasing that would not include "should". Adding this comment so that we don't have the discussion again.-->
          <dt><xmlatt>data</xmlatt></dt>
          <dd>Specifies the absolute or relative URI of the video resource. If <xmlatt>data</xmlatt>
            is specified, <xmlatt>type</xmlatt> should be specified also.</dd>
        </dlentry>
        <dlentry platform="dita">
          <!-- Identical to definition in video topic -->
          <dt><xmlatt>datakeyref</xmlatt></dt>
          <dd>Provides a key reference to the video resource. When specified and the key is
            resolvable, the key-provided URI is used. If the key referenced by
              <xmlatt>datakeyref</xmlatt> cannot be resolved, and <xmlatt>data</xmlatt> is
            specified, that value provided by <xmlatt>data</xmlatt> is used as a fallback. If the
            key referenced by <xmlatt>datakeyref</xmlatt> has no associated resource, only link
            text, and the video<xmlelement/> element does not contain a
              <xmlelement>fallback</xmlelement> element, the link text becomes fallback
            content.</dd>

        <dlentry>
          <dt><xmlatt>height</xmlatt></dt>
          <dd>Indicates the vertical dimension for the resulting display. The value of this
            attribute is a real number (expressed in decimal notation) optionally followed by a unit
            of measure from the set of cm, em, in, mm, pc, pt, px, and Q (centimeters, ems, inches,
            picas, points, pixels, millimeters, and quarter-millimeters, respectively). The default
            unit is px (pixels). Possible values include: "5", "5in", and "10.5cm". </dd>

          <!-- Identical to definition in video topic -->
          <dt><xmlatt>type</xmlatt></dt>
          <dd>Indicates the MIME type for the video resource. This attribute enables processors to
            avoid loading unsuppported resources. If <xmlatt>type</xmlatt> is not specified and
              <xmlatt>datakeyref</xmlatt> is specified, the effective type for the key named by the
              <xmlatt>datakeyref</xmlatt> attribute is used as the value. If an explicit
              <xmlatt>type</xmlatt> is not specified on either the <xmlelement>video</xmlelement>
            element or key definition, processors can use other means, such the URI file extension,
            to determine the effective MIME type of the video.</dd>

        <dlentry>
          <dt><xmlatt>width</xmlatt></dt>
          <dd>Indicates the horizontal dimension for the resulting display. The value of this
            attribute is a real number (expressed in decimal notation) optionally followed by a unit
            of measure from the set of cm, em, in, mm, pc, pt, px, and Q (centimeters, ems, inches,
            picas, points, pixels, millimeters, and quarter-millimeters, respectively). The default
            unit is px (pixels). Possible values include: "5", "5in", and "10.5cm". </dd>
